QML-Lock
========

A lock for the ubuntu touch system, as designed by Lucas Romero Di Benedetto.

To test, open Lock.qmlproject in Qt Creator. The Ubuntu SDK is required.
( http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/#step-get-toolkit )

You can play around with the colors in colors.js. 
I've already included two different color schemes.
You can also play around with the settings at Lock.qml:43-46 .

For further implementation, you will probably need the signal correct on line 36.
